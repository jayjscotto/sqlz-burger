# sqlz-burger
Utilizing the Sequelize ORM, I recreate a previously created CRUD app built with Node, Express, Handlebars, MySQL, Javascript, Sass and HTML/CSS

# Usage
Enter a burger to put it on the list, click the burger's `Eat It!` button to eat it, and then if you want to delete it, click the `Delete It!` button.

# sqlz-burger
Utilizing the Sequelize ORM, I recreate a previously created CRUD app built with Node, Express, Handlebars, MySQL, Javascript, Sass and HTML/CSS

# Usage
Enter a burger to put it on the list, click the burger's `Eat It!` button to eat it, and then if you want to delete it, click the `Delete It!` button.

# Installation && Running Locally
    - Clone the repository
    - Navigate to the project directory, and run `npm install`
    - Update `config.js` in the `development` section to your mysql credentials/information
    - run `npm start`
    - Navigate to the URL in the browser and test!
